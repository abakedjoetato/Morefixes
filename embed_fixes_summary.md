2. Missing helper functions in utils/helpers.py
3. Duplicate method declarations causing LSP errors
4. Consistency in method naming and functionality

## Details of Changes

### Added Basic Embed Methods
- `create_error_embed`: Creates error-themed embeds
- `create_success_embed`: Creates success-themed embeds
- `create_base_embed`: Creates basic embeds with standard styling
- `create_info_embed`: Creates info-themed embeds
- `create_warning_embed`: Creates warning-themed embeds

### Added Specialized Embed Methods

## Testing
All embed creation methods have been thoroughly tested to ensure they work correctly. The tests cover:
- Basic functionality (titles, descriptions)

## Impact
These fixes ensure that all cogs can successfully create and use embeds of various types for different purposes:

- Error reporting

The fixes maintain complete backward compatibility with existing code while adding new functionality.
