# Server ID Type Handling Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes implemented to address server ID type handling inconsistencies in the Tower of Temptation PvP Statistics Discord Bot.

## Problem Statement
Throughout the codebase, server IDs were inconsistently handled as both integers and strings in different parts of the application. This caused several issues:

1. Type mismatches during comparisons
2. Errors in autocomplete functions
3. Database query failures
4. Inconsistent behavior in server validation

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Consistent Type Conversion
- Added explicit string conversion for all server ID values using `str(server_id)`
- Ensured all database queries use string-typed server IDs
- Normalized server ID handling in all commands

### 2. Improved Server Lookup Functions
- Created a central `check_server_existence()` utility function that:
  - Converts server IDs to strings before comparison
  - Properly handles both dictionary and string server entries
  - Has multiple fallback methods to improve reliability

### 3. Bounties Module Fixes
- Updated `place_bounty` command to properly handle server ID types
- Fixed `active_bounties` command to ensure consistent server validation
- Improved `my_bounties` command with proper server ID type handling

### 4. Autocomplete Function Fixes
- Updated `server_id_autocomplete` functions to ensure consistent string handling
- Fixed type inconsistencies in `get_server_selection` utility

## Impact
These fixes ensure that server IDs are consistently handled as strings throughout the application, preventing type-related errors in:

- Database queries
- Server validation
- Command autocomplete
- Server comparison operations

## Testing
The fixes were validated across multiple commands and functions to ensure consistent behavior with both numeric and string-based server IDs.
